New York Road Runners (NYRR) is the largest race organizer in New York City. They host dozens of races every year, including the world-famous New York City Marathon every November. I scraped ten years of race data from their race results website, detailing the name, date, location, distance, and runner demographics of each race they've hosted since 2014. I cleaned up the data in Excel and then uploaded it into Tableau, in order to understand how NYRR's race portfolio has evolved in the past decade and how COVID impacted their race participation.<br><br>

A hypothetical superstore is planning a year-end sale, where they will offer a gold membership to existing customers. Superstore management wants to understand which factors affect a customer's response to the membership offer, based on which customers accepted the offer in the last campaign. I imported the customer data into SQL and queried it, then translated my SQL findings into a Tableau dashboard.  <br><br>

A fictional company has an HR data set with information about all of their employees, including demographics, performance ratings, and salaries. I imported the customer data into SQL and queried it. Then I created a Tableau dashboard that would allow the HR department to view a summary of their company's employeesâ€”both overall, and by specific manager.<br><br>
